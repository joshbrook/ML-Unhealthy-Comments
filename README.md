# Predicting Unhealthy Conversations

A machine learning project created to predict whether a comment is healthy or unhealthy based on a given set of parameters.

Based on the [Unhealthy Comments Corpus](https://github.com/conversationai/unhealthy-conversations) (UCC), which contains 44355 comments labelled as either 'healthy' or 'unhealthy', in addition to binary labels for the presence of six potentially 'unhealthy' sub-attributes: 
- hostile
- antagonistic, insulting, provocative or trolling
- dismissive
- condescending or patronising
- sarcastic
- unfair generalisation

A classification algorithm is set up and run on the data, and hyperparamter tuning is employed to best fit the automatically generated labels to the given ones. 

A full writeup detailing process, decisions, and implementation is provided in PDF format in the [report](report) folder, which has been writen using Orgmode in Emacs and exported through LaTeX
